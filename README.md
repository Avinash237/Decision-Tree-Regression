# Decision-Tree-Regression
This Regression is based on the decision tree structure. A decision tree is a form of a tree or hierarchical structure that breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets. At the same time, an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. The tree contains decision nodes and leaf nodes. The decision nodes(e.g. Outlook) are those nodes represent the value of the input variable(x). It has two or more than two branches(e.g. Sunny, Overcast, Rainy). The leaf nodes(e.g. Hours Played) contains the decision or the output variable(y). The decision node that corresponds to the best predictor becomes the topmost node and called the root node.
